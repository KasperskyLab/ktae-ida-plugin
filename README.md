# Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE) IDA Pro Plugin

Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine analyzes a file, or a sample, and attributes it to known advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, their tools, related malware, and campaigns.

This plugin demonstrates the usage of KTAE API to highlight genotypes (pieces of binary code) and strings of APT samples in IDA Pro.

## Installation:

1. Replace API_URL with the URL of your KTAE installation and API_KEY with your KTAE API key.
2. Copy ktae.py to IDA Pro's plugins folder.
